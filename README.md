### About This Fork

This fork of [vzhou842/neural-network-from-scratch](https://github.com/vzhou842/neural-network-from-scratch) introduces the following enhancements:
1. **Weight Initialization Options**: Supports `normal`, `Xavier`, and `He` initialization methods for experimentation.
2. **CSV Data Loader**: Easily load datasets from a CSV file for training and testing.
3. **Metrics Tracking**: Adds loss and accuracy tracking for insights into training performance.

These changes allow users to observe how initialization and hyperparameter tuning affect neural network performance.
